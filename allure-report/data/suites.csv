"Testing alphabet_war function [with battlefield='ab#de[fgh]ijk', expected='fgh'].

        Introduction
        There is a war and nobody knows - the alphabet war!
        The letters hide in their nuclear shelters. The
        nuclear strikes hit the battlefield and killed a
        lot of them.

        Task
        Write a function that accepts battlefield string
        and returns letters that survived the nuclear strike.

        1. The battlefield string consists of only small letters, #,[ and ].

        2. The nuclear shelter is represented by square brackets [].
        The letters inside the square brackets represent letters
        inside the shelter.

        3. The # means a place where nuclear strike hit the battlefield.
        If there is at least one # on the battlefield, all letters outside
        of shelter die. When there is no any # on the battlefield, all letters
        survive (but do not expect such scenario too often ;-P ).

        4. The shelters have some durability. When 2 or more # hit close to
        the shelter, the shelter is destroyed and all letters inside evaporate.
        The 'close to the shelter' means on the ground between the shelter and
        the next shelter (or beginning/end of battlefield). The below samples
        make it clear for you.

        Introduction
        There is a war and nobody knows - the alphabet war!
        The letters hide in their nuclear shelters. The
        nuclear strikes hit the battlefield and killed a
        lot of them.

        Task
        Write a function that accepts battlefield string
        and returns letters that survived the nuclear strike.

        1. The battlefield string consists of only small letters, #,[ and ].

        2. The nuclear shelter is represented by square brackets [].
        The letters inside the square brackets represent letters
        inside the shelter.

        3. The # means a place where nuclear strike hit the battlefield.
        If there is at least one # on the battlefield, all letters outside
        of shelter die. When there is no any # on the battlefield, all letters
        survive (but do not expect such scenario too often ;-P ).

        4. The shelters have some durability. When 2 or more # hit close to
        the shelter, the shelter is destroyed and all letters inside evaporate.
        The 'close to the shelter' means on the ground between the shelter and
        the next shelter (or beginning/end of battlefield). The below samples
        make it clear for you.

        Introduction
        There is a war and nobody knows - the alphabet war!
        The letters hide in their nuclear shelters. The
        nuclear strikes hit the battlefield and killed a
        lot of them.

        Task
        Write a function that accepts battlefield string
        and returns letters that survived the nuclear strike.

        1. The battlefield string consists of only small letters, #,[ and ].

        2. The nuclear shelter is represented by square brackets [].
        The letters inside the square brackets represent letters
        inside the shelter.

        3. The # means a place where nuclear strike hit the battlefield.
        If there is at least one # on the battlefield, all letters outside
        of shelter die. When there is no any # on the battlefield, all letters
        survive (but do not expect such scenario too often ;-P ).

        4. The shelters have some durability. When 2 or more # hit close to
        the shelter, the shelter is destroyed and all letters inside evaporate.
        The 'close to the shelter' means on the ground between the shelter and
        the next shelter (or beginning/end of battlefield). The below samples
        make it clear for you.

        Task
        Write a function that accepts battlefield string
        and returns letters that survived the nuclear strike.

        1. The battlefield string consists of only small letters, #,[ and ].

        2. The nuclear shelter is represented by square brackets [].
        The letters inside the square brackets represent letters
        inside the shelter.

        3. The # means a place where nuclear strike hit the battlefield.
        If there is at least one # on the battlefield, all letters outside
        of shelter die. When there is no any # on the battlefield, all letters
        survive (but do not expect such scenario too often ;-P ).

        4. The shelters have some durability. When 2 or more # hit close to
        the shelter, the shelter is destroyed and all letters inside evaporate.
        The 'close to the shelter' means on the ground between the shelter and

"Testing alphabet_war function [with battlefield='##abde[fgh]ijk[mn]op', expected='mn'].

        Introduction
        There is a war and nobody knows - the alphabet war!
        The letters hide in their nuclear shelters. The
        nuclear strikes hit the battlefield and killed a
        lot of them.

        Task
        Write a function that accepts battlefield string
        and returns letters that survived the nuclear strike.

        1. The battlefield string consists of only small letters, #,[ and ].

        2. The nuclear shelter is represented by square brackets [].
        The letters inside the square brackets represent letters
        inside the shelter.

        3. The # means a place where nuclear strike hit the battlefield.
        If there is at least one # on the battlefield, all letters outside
        of shelter die. When there is no any # on the battlefield, all letters
        survive (but do not expect such scenario too often ;-P ).

        4. The shelters have some durability. When 2 or more # hit close to
        the shelter, the shelter is destroyed and all letters inside evaporate.
        The 'close to the shelter' means on the ground between the shelter and
        the next shelter (or beginning/end of battlefield). The below samples
        make it clear for you.

        Introduction
        There is a war and nobody knows - the alphabet war!
        The letters hide in their nuclear shelters. The
        nuclear strikes hit the battlefield and killed a
        lot of them.

        Task
        Write a function that accepts battlefield string
        and returns letters that survived the nuclear strike.

        1. The battlefield string consists of only small letters, #,[ and ].

        2. The nuclear shelter is represented by square brackets [].
        The letters inside the square brackets represent letters
        inside the shelter.

        3. The # means a place where nuclear strike hit the battlefield.
        If there is at least one # on the battlefield, all letters outside
        of shelter die. When there is no any # on the battlefield, all letters
        survive (but do not expect such scenario too often ;-P ).

        4. The shelters have some durability. When 2 or more # hit close to
        the shelter, the shelter is destroyed and all letters inside evaporate.
        The 'close to the shelter' means on the ground between the shelter and
        the next shelter (or beginning/end of battlefield). The below samples
        make it clear for you.

        For this exercise you will create a global flatten method.
        The method takes in any number of arguments and flattens

        are an array then the individual objects within the array
        will be flattened so that they exist at the same level as
        the other arguments. Any nested arrays, no matter how deep,
        should be flattened into the single array result.

"Testing alphabet_war function [with battlefield='abcde[fgh]', expected='abcdefgh'].

        Introduction
        There is a war and nobody knows - the alphabet war!
        The letters hide in their nuclear shelters. The
        nuclear strikes hit the battlefield and killed a
        lot of them.

        Task
        Write a function that accepts battlefield string
        and returns letters that survived the nuclear strike.

        1. The battlefield string consists of only small letters, #,[ and ].

        2. The nuclear shelter is represented by square brackets [].
        The letters inside the square brackets represent letters
        inside the shelter.

        3. The # means a place where nuclear strike hit the battlefield.
        If there is at least one # on the battlefield, all letters outside
        of shelter die. When there is no any # on the battlefield, all letters
        survive (but do not expect such scenario too often ;-P ).

        4. The shelters have some durability. When 2 or more # hit close to
        the shelter, the shelter is destroyed and all letters inside evaporate.
        The 'close to the shelter' means on the ground between the shelter and
        the next shelter (or beginning/end of battlefield). The below samples
        make it clear for you.
