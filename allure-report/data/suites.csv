		Introduction
		There is a war and nobody knows - the alphabet war!
		The letters hide in their nuclear shelters. The

		lot of them.

		Task
		Write a function that accepts battlefield string
		and returns letters that survived the nuclear strike.

		1. The battlefield string consists of only small letters, #,[ and ].

		2. The nuclear shelter is represented by square brackets [].
		The letters inside the square brackets represent letters
		inside the shelter.

		3. The # means a place where nuclear strike hit the battlefield.
		If there is at least one # on the battlefield, all letters outside
		of shelter die. When there is no any # on the battlefield, all letters
		survive (but do not expect such scenario too often ;-P ).

		4. The shelters have some durability. When 2 or more # hit close to
		the shelter, the shelter is destroyed and all letters inside evaporate.
		The 'close to the shelter' means on the ground between the shelter and
		the next shelter (or beginning/end of battlefield). The below samples

		Task

		meters due to the lack of sun heat. Initially, plant
		is 0 meters tall. We plant the seed at the beginning
		of a day. We want to know when the height of the plant

		Example

		For upSpeed = 100, downSpeed = 10 and desiredHeight = 910,

		For upSpeed = 10, downSpeed = 9 and desiredHeight = 4,

		Input/Output
