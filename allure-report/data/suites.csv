        Testing tickets function with various test inputs.

        The new ""Avengers"" movie has just been released!
        There are a lot of people at the cinema box office
        standing in a huge line. Each of them has a single
        100, 50 or 25 dollar bill. An ""Avengers"" ticket
        costs 25 dollars.

        Vasya is currently working as a clerk.
        He wants to sell a ticket to every single person
        in this line.

        Can Vasya sell a ticket to every person and give change
        if he initially has no money and sells the tickets strictly
        in the order people queue?

        The function should return YES, if Vasya can sell
        a ticket to every person and give change with the
        bills he has at hand at that moment. Otherwise return NO.

        Testing 'factorial' function

        By convention the value of 0! is 1.

        Write a function to calculate factorial for a given input.

        Testing growing_plant function

        Task

        Each day a plant is growing by upSpeed meters.
        Each night that plant's height decreases by downSpeed
        meters due to the lack of sun heat. Initially, plant
        is 0 meters tall. We plant the seed at the beginning
        of a day. We want to know when the height of the plant
        will reach a certain level.

        Example

        For upSpeed = 100, downSpeed = 10 and desiredHeight = 910,
        the output should be 10.

        For upSpeed = 10, downSpeed = 9 and desiredHeight = 4,
        the output should be 1. Because the plant reach to the desired
        height at day 1(10 meters).

        Input/Output

        [input] integer upSpeed
        A positive integer representing the daily growth.
        Constraints: 5 ≤ upSpeed ≤ 100.

        [input] integer downSpeed
        A positive integer representing the nightly decline.
        Constraints: 2 ≤ downSpeed < upSpeed.

        [input] integer desiredHeight
        A positive integer representing the threshold.
        Constraints: 4 ≤ desiredHeight ≤ 1000.

        [output] an integer

        The number of days that it will take for the plant to
        reach/pass desiredHeight (including the last day in the
        total count).

        Testing alphabet_war function

        Introduction
        There is a war and nobody knows - the alphabet war!
        The letters hide in their nuclear shelters. The
        nuclear strikes hit the battlefield and killed a
        lot of them.

        Task
        Write a function that accepts battlefield string
        and returns letters that survived the nuclear strike.

        1. The battlefield string consists of only small letters, #,[ and ].

        2. The nuclear shelter is represented by square brackets [].
        The letters inside the square brackets represent letters
        inside the shelter.

        3. The # means a place where nuclear strike hit the battlefield.
        If there is at least one # on the battlefield, all letters outside
        of shelter die. When there is no any # on the battlefield, all letters
        survive (but do not expect such scenario too often ;-P ).

        4. The shelters have some durability. When 2 or more # hit close to
        the shelter, the shelter is destroyed and all letters inside evaporate.
        The 'close to the shelter' means on the ground between the shelter and
        the next shelter (or beginning/end of battlefield). The below samples
        make it clear for you.

        In this kata, you must create a digital root function.

        For this exercise you will create a global flatten method.
        The method takes in any number of arguments and flattens
        them into a single array. If any of the arguments passed in
        are an array then the individual objects within the array
        will be flattened so that they exist at the same level as
        the other arguments. Any nested arrays, no matter how deep,
        should be flattened into the single array result.

        The following are examples of how this function would be
        used and what the expected results would be:

        flatten(1, [2, 3], 4, 5, [6, [7]]) # returns [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]
