# Organizing and Simplifying Your Codebase with Utilities and Helper Functions

Python Utils is a collection of small Python functions and classes which make
common patterns shorter and easier. It is by no means a complete collection
but it has served me quite a bit in the past and I will keep extending it.

Utilities and helper functions are a crucial part of any Python project,
as they help to organize and simplify the codebase. When written correctly,
these functions can improve the readability and maintainability of the project,
making it easier for others (or even yourself) to understand and work with the
code.

In conclusion, writing good utility and helper functions can greatly improve the
organization, readability, and maintainability of your Python codebase. By keeping
functions small and focused, following naming conventions, documenting functions
with docstrings, organizing the code with clear file structure, and testing the
functions, you can make sure your functions are well-written and easy to work with.
