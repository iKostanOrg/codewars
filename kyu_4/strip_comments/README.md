# Strip Comments

Complete the solution so that it strips all text that follows any of
a set of comment markers passed in. Any whitespace at the end of the
line should also be stripped out.

## Example

Given an input string of:

```text
apples, pears # and bananas
grapes
bananas !apples
```

The output expected would be:

```text
apples, pears
grapes
bananas
```

The code would be called like so:

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD013 -->
```text
result = solution("apples, pears # and bananas\ngrapes\nbananas !apples", ["#", "!"])
# result should == "apples, pears\ngrapes\nbananas"
```
<!-- markdownlint-enable MD013 -->
