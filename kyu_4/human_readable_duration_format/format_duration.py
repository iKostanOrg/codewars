def format_duration(seconds: int) -> str:
    """
    A function which formats a duration, given as a
    number of seconds, in a human-friendly way.

    The resulting expression is made of components like 4 seconds,
    1 year, etc. In general, a positive integer and one of the
    valid units of time, separated by a space. The unit of time
    is used in plural if the integer is greater than 1.

    The components are separated by a comma and a space (", ").
    Except the last component, which is separated by " and ", just
    like it would be written in English.

    A more significant units of time will occur before than a least
    significant one. Therefore, 1 second and 1 year is not correct,
    but 1 year and 1 second is.

    Different components have different unit of times. So there is
    not repeated units like in 5 seconds and 1 second.

    A component will not appear at all if its value happens to be zero.
    Hence, 1 minute and 0 seconds is not valid, but it should be just 1 minute.

    A unit of time must be used "as much as possible". It means that the
    function should not return 61 seconds, but 1 minute and 1 second instead.
    Formally, the duration specified by of a component must not be greater than
    any valid more significant unit of time.
