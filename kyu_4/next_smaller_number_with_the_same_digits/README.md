## Next smaller number with the same digits

Write a function that takes a positive integer and returns the next
smaller positive integer containing the same digits.

For example:

```text
next_smaller(21) == 12
next_smaller(531) == 513
next_smaller(2071) == 2017
```

Return `-1` (for `Haskell`: return `Nothing`, for `Rust`: return `None`),
when there is no smaller number that contains the same digits. Also return
`-1` when the next smaller number with the same digits would require the
leading digit to be zero.

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD013 -->
```text
next_smaller(9) == -1
next_smaller(135) == -1
next_smaller(1027) == -1  # 0721 is out since we don't write numbers with leading zeros
```
<!-- markdownlint-enable MD013 -->

-   some tests will include very large numbers.
-   test data only employs positive integers.

The function you write for this challenge is the inverse of this kata:
