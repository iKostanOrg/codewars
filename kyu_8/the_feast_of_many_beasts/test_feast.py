        Testing 'feast' function with various test inputs

        Testing a function feast that takes the animal's
        name and dish as arguments and returns true or
        false to indicate whether the beast is allowed
        to bring the dish to the feast.

        Assume that beast and dish are always lowercase strings,
        and that each has at least two letters. beast and dish
        may contain hyphens and spaces, but these will not appear
        at the beginning or end of the string. They will not
        contain numerals.

        There is just one rule: the dish must start and end with
        the same letters as the animal's name. For example, the
        great blue heron is bringing garlic naan and the chickadee
        is bringing chocolate cake.
