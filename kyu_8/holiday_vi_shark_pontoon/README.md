# Holiday VI - Shark Pontoon

Your friend invites you out to a cool floating pontoon around 1km
off the beach. Among other things, the pontoon has a huge slide that
drops you out right into the ocean, a small way from a set of stairs
used to climb out.

As you plunge out of the slide into the water, you see a shark hovering
in the darkness under the pontoon... Crap!

You need to work out if the shark will get to you before you can get to
the pontoon. To make it easier... as you do the mental calculations in
the water you either freeze when you realise you are dead, or swim when
you realise you can make it!

You are given 5 variables: sharkDistance = distance the shark needs to
cover to eat you in metres, sharkSpeed = how fast it can move in metres/second,
pontoonDistance = how far you need to swim to safety in metres, youSpeed = how
fast you can swim in metres/second, dolphin = a boolean, if true, you can half
the swimming speed of the shark as the dolphin will attack it.

If you make it, return "Alive!", if not, return "Shark Bait!".
