# Compare within margin

## Description

Create a function close_compare that accepts 3 parameters: `a, b, and an optional margin`.
The function should return whether `a` is lower than, close to, or higher than `b`.

### Please note the following

- When `a` is close to `b`, return `0`.
    - For this challenge, `a` is considered "close to" `b` if `margin` is greater than or equal to the
absolute distance between `a` and `b`.

Otherwise...

- When `a` is less than `b`, return `-1`.
- When `a` is greater than `b`, return `1`.

If margin is not given, treat it as if it were zero.

Assume: `margin >= 0`

Tip: Some languages have a way to make parameters optional.
