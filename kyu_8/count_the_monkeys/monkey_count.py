    You take your son to the forest to see the monkeys.
    You know that there are a certain number there (n),

    number, he has to start counting them from 1.

    As a good parent, you will sit and count with him.
    Given the number (n), populate an array with all
    numbers up to and including that number, but
    excluding zero.
