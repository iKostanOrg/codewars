# 101 Dalmatians - squash the bugs, not the dogs!

## Description

Your friend has been out shopping for puppies (what a time to be alive!)...
He arrives back with multiple dogs, and you simply do not know how to respond!

By repairing the function provided, you will find out exactly how you should
respond, depending on the number of dogs he has.

The number of dogs will always be a number and there will always be at least 1 dog.

### [ASTEVAL](https://pypi.org/project/asteval/)

The asteval module allows you to evaluate a large subset of the Python language
from within a python program, without using `eval()`. It is, in effect, a restricted
version of Pythonâ€™s built-in `eval()`, forbidding several actions, and using
(by default) a simple dictionary as a flat namespace.
