# Number of trailing zeros of N

Write a program that will calculate the number of trailing zeros
in a factorial of a given number.

`N! = 1 * 2 * 3 * ... * N`

Be careful 1000! has 2568 digits...

[For more info, see here](http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Factorial.html)

## Examples

```bash
zeros(6) = 1
# 6! = 1 * 2 * 3 * 4 * 5 * 6 = 720 --> 1 trailing zero

zeros(12) = 2
# 12! = 479001600 --> 2 trailing zeros
```

Hint: You're not meant to calculate the factorial. Find another way to
find the number of zeros.
