    A function dir_reduc which will take an array of strings
    and returns an array of strings with the needless
    directions removed (W<->E or S<->N side by side).

    The Haskell version takes a list of directions with data
    Direction = North | East | West | South.

    The Clojure version returns nil when the path is reduced
    to nothing.

    The Rust version takes a slice of enum Direction
    {NORTH, SOUTH, EAST, WEST}.
