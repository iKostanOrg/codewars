## Sudoku rules

Complete the Sudoku puzzle so that each and every row, column,
and region contains the numbers one through nine only once.

### Rows

![Row](https://github.com/ikostan/codewars/blob/master/img/Row.gif)

There are `9` rows in a traditional Sudoku puzzle. Every row must
contain the numbers `1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9`. There may not
be any duplicate numbers in any row. In other words, there can not
be any rows that are identical.

In the illustration the numbers `5, 3, 1, and 2` are the "givens".
They can not be changed. The remaining numbers in black are the numbers
that you fill in to complete the row.

### Columns

![Column](https://github.com/ikostan/codewars/blob/master/img/Column.gif)

There are 9 columns in a traditional Sudoku puzzle. Like the Sudoku rule
for rows, every column must also contain the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7,
8, and 9. Again, there may not be any duplicate numbers in any column. Each
column will be unique as a result.

In the illustration the numbers 7, 2, and 6 are the "givens". They can not
be changed. You fill in the remaining numbers as shown in black to complete
the column.

### Regions

![Region](https://github.com/ikostan/codewars/blob/master/img/Region.gif)

A region is a 3x3 box like the one shown to the left. There are 9 regions in
a traditional Sudoku puzzle.

Like the Sudoku requirements for rows and columns, every region must also contain
the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9. Duplicate numbers are not permitted in
any region. Each region will differ from the other regions.

In the illustration the numbers 1, 2, and 8 are the "givens". They can not be
changed. Fill in the remaining numbers as shown in black to complete the region.
