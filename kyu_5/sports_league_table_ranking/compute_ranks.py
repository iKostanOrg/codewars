    """
    organize a sports league in a round-robin-system. Each team meets
    all other teams. In your league a win gives a team 2 points, a
    draw gives both teams 1 point. After some games you have to compute
    the order of the teams in your league. You use the following criteria
    to arrange the teams:

    Points
    Scoring differential (the difference between goals scored and those conceded)

    Goals scored
    First you sort the teams by their points. If two or more teams reached the same
    number of points, the second criteria comes into play and so on. Finally, if all
    criteria are the same, the teams share a place.
