# Integers: Recreation One

Divisors of `42` are : `1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 14, 21, 42`. These divisors squared
are: `1, 4, 9, 36, 49, 196, 441, 1764`. The sum of the squared divisors is
`2500` which is `50 * 50`, a square!

Given two integers `m, n (1 <= m <= n)` we want to find all integers between
m and n whose sum of squared divisors is itself a square. `42` is such a number.

The result will be an array of arrays or of tuples (in C an array of Pair) or
a string, each sub-array having two elements, first the number whose squared
divisors is a square and then the sum of the squared divisors.

## Examples

```text
list_squared(1, 250) --> [[1, 1], [42, 2500], [246, 84100]]
list_squared(42, 250) --> [[42, 2500], [246, 84100]]
```
