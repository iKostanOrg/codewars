# Diophantine Equation

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD013 -->
In mathematics, a [Diophantine equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diophantine_equation) is a polynomial
equation, usually with two or more unknowns, such that only the
integer solutions are sought or studied.

In this kata we want to find all integers `x, y (x >= 0, y >= 0)`
solutions of a diophantine equation of the form:

```text
x2 - 4 * y2 = n
```

(where the unknowns are `x` and `y`, and `n` is a given positive number)
in decreasing order of the positive `xi`.

If there is no solution return `[]` or `"[]"` or `""`. (See "RUN SAMPLE
TESTS" for examples of returns).

## Examples:
<!-- markdownlint-disable MD013 -->
```text
solEquaStr(90005) --> "[[45003, 22501], [9003, 4499], [981, 467], [309, 37]]"
solEquaStr(90002) --> "[]"
```
<!-- markdownlint-enable MD013 -->

## Hint:

```text
x2 - 4 * y2 = (x - 2*y) * (x + 2*y)
```
