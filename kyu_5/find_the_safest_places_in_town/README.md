# Find the safest places in town

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD013 -->
[Laura Bassi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laura_Bassi) was the first female professor at a European university.
Despite her immense intellect, she was not always allowed to lecture publicly.
<!-- markdownlint-enable MD013 -->

One day a professor with very strong beliefs against women in academia sent
some `agents` to find Bassi and end her career.

Help her escape by telling her the safest places in town!

## Task

Implement the function `advice(agents, n)` where

-   agents is an array of agent coordinates.
-   `n` defines the size of the city that Bassi needs to hide in, in other
    words the side length of the square grid.

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD013 -->
The function should return a list of coordinates that are the furthest away
(by [Manhattan distance](https://xlinux.nist.gov/dads/HTML/manhattanDistance.html)) from all agents.
<!-- markdownlint-enable MD013 -->

As an example, say you have a 6x6 map, and agents at locations
```text
[(0, 0), (1, 5), (5, 1)]
```

The distances to the nearest agent look like this.

![Safest](https://github.com/ikostan/codewars/blob/master/img/safest.png)

The safest spaces are the ones with distance 4, marked in bright red. So the
function should return:
```text
[(2, 2), (3, 3), (4, 4), (5, 5)]
```
in any order.

Edge cases:

-   If there is an agent on every grid cell, there is no safe space, so return
    an empty list.
-   If there are no agents, then every cell is a safe spaces, so return all
    coordinates.
-   If n is 0, return an empty list.
-   If agent coordinates are outside of the map, they are simply not considered.
-   There are no duplicate agents on the same square.

## Performance

There are `200` random tests with `n <= 50`. Inefficient solutions might time out.
