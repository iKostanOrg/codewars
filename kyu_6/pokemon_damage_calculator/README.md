# Pokemon Damage Calculator

It's a Pokemon battle! Your task is to calculate the damage that
a particular move would do using the following formula (not the
actual one from the game):

```text
damage = 50 * (attack / defense) * effectiveness
```

Where:

*   attack = your attack power
*   defense = the opponent's defense
*   effectiveness = the effectiveness of the attack based on the
    matchup (see explanation below)

## Effectiveness

Attacks can be super effective, neutral, or not very effective depending
on the matchup. For example, water would be super effective against fire,
but not very effective against grass.

*   Super effective: 2x damage
*   Neutral: 1x damage
*   Not very effective: 0.5x damage

To prevent this kata from being tedious, you'll only be dealing with four
types: `fire`, `water`, `grass`, and `electric`. Here is the effectiveness
of each matchup:

*   fire > grass
*   fire < water
*   fire = electric
*   water < grass
*   water < electric
*   grass = electric

For this kata, any type against itself is not very effective. Also, assume
that the relationships between different types are symmetric (if `A` is
super effective against `B`, then `B` is not very effective `A`).

The function you must implement takes in:

1.  your type
2.  the opponent's type
3.  your attack power
4.  the opponent's defense
