    In this kata, you must create a digital root function.

    A digital root is the recursive sum of all the digits
    in a number. Given n, take the sum of the digits of n.
    If that value has more than one digit, continue reducing
    in this way until a single-digit number is produced. This
    is only applicable to the natural numbers.
