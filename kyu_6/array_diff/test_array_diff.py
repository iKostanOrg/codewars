    Testing array_diff function

    Your goal in this kata is to implement a difference function,
    which subtracts one list from another and returns the result.

    It should remove all values from list a, which are present
    in list b:
    array_diff([1,2],[1]) == [2]

    If a value is present in b, all of its occurrences must be
    removed from the other:
    array_diff([1,2,2,2,3],[2]) == [1,3]
