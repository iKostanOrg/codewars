    Binary to string.

    Write a function that takes in a binary string
    and returns the equivalent decoded text
    (the text is ASCII encoded).

    Each 8 bits on the binary string represent
    1 character on the ASCII table.

    The input string will always be a valid binary string.

    Characters can be in the range from "00000000"
    to "11111111" (inclusive)

    Note: In the case of an empty binary string your
    function should return an empty string
