# Binary to Text (ASCII) Conversion

Write a function that takes in a binary string and returns the equivalent
decoded text (the text is ASCII encoded).

Each 8 bits on the binary string represent 1 character on the ASCII table.

The input string will always be a valid binary string.

Characters can be in the range from "00000000" to "11111111" (inclusive)

Note: In the case of an empty binary string your function should return an
empty string.
