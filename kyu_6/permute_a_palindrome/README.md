## Permute a Palindrome

Write a function that will check whether the permutation of an input string is a palindrome. Bonus points for a solution that is efficient and/or that uses only built-in language functions. Deem yourself brilliant if you can come up with a version that does not use any function whatsoever.

Example:

> madam -> True

> adamm -> True

> junk -> False

**Hint** -> the brute force approach would be to generate all the permutations of the string and check each one of them whether it is a palindrome. However, an optimized approach will not require this at all.
