# Permute a Palindrome

Write a function that will check whether the permutation of an
input string is a palindrome. Bonus points for a solution that
is efficient and/or that uses only built-in language functions.
Deem yourself brilliant if you can come up with a version that
does not use any function whatsoever.

Example:

> madam -> True
>
> adamm -> True
>
> junk -> False

**Hint** -> the brute force approach would be to generate all the
permutations of the string and check each one of them whether it
is a palindrome. However, an optimized approach will not require
this at all.
