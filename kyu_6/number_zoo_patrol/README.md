# Number Zoo Patrol

## Task

Write a function that takes a shuffled list of unique numbers from
`1` to `n` with one element missing (which can be any number including
`n`). Return this missing number.

Note: huge lists will be tested.

### Examples

```text
[1, 3, 4]  =>  2
[1, 2, 3]  =>  4
[4, 2, 3]  =>  1
```
