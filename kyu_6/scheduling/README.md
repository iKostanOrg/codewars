# Scheduling (Shortest Job First or SJF)

Scheduling is how the processor decides which jobs(processes) get to use 
the processor and for how long. This can cause a lot of problems. Like a 
really long process taking the entire CPU and freezing all the other  
processes. One solution is Shortest Job First(SJF), which today you will 
be implementing.

SJF works by, well, letting the shortest jobs take the CPU first. If the 
jobs are the same size then it is First In First Out (FIFO). The idea is 
that the shorter jobs will finish quicker, so theoretically jobs won't 
get frozen because of large jobs. (In practice they're frozen because of 
small jobs).

You will be implementing:

```python
def SJF(jobs, index)
```

## It takes in:

1. "jobs" a non-empty array of positive integers. They represent the 
    clock-cycles(cc) needed to finish the job.
2. "index" a positive integer. That represents the job we're interested in.

## SJF returns:

1. A positive integer representing the cc it takes to complete the job at index.

2. Here's an example:

```text
SJF([3, 10, 20, 1, 2], 0)
at 0cc [3, 10, 20, 1, 2] jobs[3] starts
at 1cc [3, 10, 20, 0, 2] jobs[3] finishes, jobs[4] starts
at 3cc [3, 10, 20, 0, 0] jobs[4] finishes, jobs[0] starts
at 6cc [0, 10, 20, 0, 0] jobs[0] finishes
```

so:

```text
SJF([3,10,20,1,2], 0) == 6
```
