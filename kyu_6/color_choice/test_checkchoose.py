        In mathematics the number of x combinations you can take from a
        set of n elements is called the binomial coefficient of n and x,
        or more often n choose x. The formula to compute m = n choose x is:
        m = n! / (x! * (n - x)!) where ! is the factorial operator.

        You are a renowned poster designer and painter. You are asked to
        provide 6 posters all having the same design each in 2 colors.
        Posters must all have a different color combination and you have

        can you choose for each poster?
