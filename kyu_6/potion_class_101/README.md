# Potion Class 101

## Description

This is your first potion class in Hogwarts and professor gave you
a homework to figure out what color potion will turn into if he'll
mix it with some other potion. All potions have some color that
written down as RGB color from `[0, 0, 0]` to `[255, 255, 255]`.
To make task more complicated teacher will do few mixing and after
will ask you for final color. Besides color you also need to figure
out what volume will have potion after final mix.

### Task

Based on your programming background you managed to figure that after
mixing two potions colors will mix as if mix two RGB colors. For example,
if you'll mix potion that have color `[255, 255, 0]` and volume 10 with
one that have color `[0, 254, 0]` and volume 5, you'll get new potion
with color `[170, 255, 0]` and volume 15. So you decided to create a
class Potion that will have two properties: color (a list with 3 integers)
and volume (a number), and one method mix that will accept another Potion
and return a mixed Potion.

Example:

```python
felix_felicis       =  Potion([255, 255, 255],  7)
shrinking_solution  =  Potion([ 51, 102,  51], 12)
new_potion          =  felix_felicis.mix(shrinking_solution)

new_potion.color   ==  [127, 159, 127]
new_potion.volume  ==  19
```

**Note:** Use ceiling when calculating the resulting potion's color.
