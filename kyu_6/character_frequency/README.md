# Character frequency

Write a function that takes a piece of text in the form of a string
and returns the letter frequency count for the text. This count excludes
numbers, spaces and all punctuation marks. Upper and lower case versions
of a character are equivalent and the result should all be in lowercase.

The function should return a list of tuples (in Python and Haskell) or
arrays (in other languages) sorted by the most frequent letters first.
The Rust implementation should return an ordered BTreeMap. Letters with
the same frequency are ordered alphabetically. For example:

> letter_frequency('aaAabb dddDD hhcc')

will return

> `[('d',5), ('a',4), ('b',2), ('c',2), ('h',2)]`

Letter frequency analysis is often used to analyse simple substitution
cipher texts like those created by the Caesar cipher.
