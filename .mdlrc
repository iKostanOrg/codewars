# Markdownlint has several options you can configure both on the command line,
# or in markdownlint's configuration file: .mdlrc, first looked for in the
# working directory, then in your home directory. While markdownlint will work
# perfectly well out of the box, this page documents some of the options you
# can change to suit your needs.
