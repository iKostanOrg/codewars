### Online Documentation

Python3 solutions for codewars problems’s documentation is built
with Sphinx using a theme provided by Read the Docs.

Sphinx is a tool that makes it easy to create intelligent and
beautiful documentation.

[Online version of the latest tech documentation](https://codewars.readthedocs.io/)

### Allure Report

Allure is based on standard xUnit results output but adds some
supplementary data. Any report is generated in two steps. During
test execution (first step), a small library called adapter attached
to the testing framework saves information about executed tests
to XML files.

During report generation (second step), the XML files are transformed
to a HTML report. This can be done with a command line tool, a plugin
for CI or a build tool.

  <summary>Setting up Python3 virtual environment on Windows machine</summary>

1.  open CMD
2.  navigate to project directory, for example:
    ```bash cd C:\Users\superadmin\Desktop\Python\CodinGame```
3.  run following command:
    ```bash  pip install virtualenv ```

  <summary>Setting up Python3 virtual environment on Linx (Ubuntu) machine</summary>

### How to install virtualenv

1.  Install **pip** first:
   ```bash sudo apt-get install python3-pip```
2.  Then install **virtualenv** using pip3:
    ```bash sudo pip3 install virtualenv```
3.  Now create a virtual environment (>you can use any name instead of **venv**):
    ```bash virtualenv venv```
4.  You can also use a Python interpreter of your choice:
    ```bash virtualenv -p /usr/bin/python2.7 venv```
5.  Active your virtual environment:
    ```bash source venv/bin/activate```
6.  Using fish shell:
    ```bash source venv/bin/activate.fish```
7.  To deactivate:
    ```bash deactivate```
8.  Create virtualenv using Python3:
    ```bash virtualenv -p python3 myenv```
9.  Instead of using virtualenv you can use this command in Python3:
    ```bash python3 -m venv myenv```

  <summary>Activate Virtual Environment</summary>

In a newly created virtualenv there will be a bin/activate shell script.
For Windows systems, activation scripts are provided for CMD.exe and Powershell.

1.  Open Terminal
2.  Run: `\path\to\env\Scripts\activate`

  <summary>Auto generate requirements.txt</summary>

Any application typically has a set of dependencies that are required
for that application to work. The requirements file is a way to specify 
and install specific set of package dependencies at once.

Use pip’s freeze command to generate a requirements.txt file for your project:
```bash
pip freeze > requirements.txt
```

If you save this in requirements.txt, you can follow this guide:
[PyCharm - Manage dependencies using requirements.txt](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/managing-dependencies.html),
or you can:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

  <summary>How to fix in case .gitignore is ignored by Git</summary>

Even if you haven't tracked the files so far, Git seems to be able to "know"
about them even after you add them to .gitignore

**NOTE:**

*   First commit your current changes, or you will lose them.
*   Then run the following commands from the top folder of your Git repository:

```bash 
git rm -r --cached .
git add .
git commit -m "fixed untracked files"
```

  <summary>Read-the-docs build fails with “cannot import name 'PackageFinder' from 'pip._internal.index'</summary>

The issue and the fix are described in 
[read-the-docs issue #6554](https://github.com/readthedocs/readthedocs.org/issues/6554):

The fix is to wipe out the build environment as follows ([the source see here](https://docs.readthedocs.io/en/stable/guides/wipe-environment.html)):

*   Log in to read-the-docs
*   Go to Versions
*   Click on the Edit button of the version you want to wipe
    on the right side of the page
*   Go to the bottom of the page and click the wipe link, next
    to the “Save” button
*   Now you can re-build the version with a fresh build environment!

This fix worked for me (but as of 26-Jan-2020 you have to wipe out
the environment for every build, see comment from Grimmy below).

<summary>ERROR: The term 'make' is not recognized as the name of a cmdlet</summary>

The error "'make' is not recognized as an internal or external command, operable program or
batch file" occurs when we run the make command on Windows without having make installed.
To solve the error, install make using Chocolatey.

```bash
make clean
make : The term 'make' is not recognized as the name of a cmdlet, function, script file, or operable program. Check the spelling of the name, or if a path 
was included, verify that the path is correct and try again.
At line:1 char:1
+ make clean
+ ~~~~
    + CategoryInfo          : ObjectNotFound: (make:String) [], CommandNotFoundException
    + FullyQualifiedErrorId : CommandNotFoundException


Suggestion [3,General]: The command make was not found, but does exist in the current location. Windows PowerShell does not load commands from the current location by default. If you trust this command, instead type: ".\make". See "get-help about_Command_Precedence" for more details.
```

To install Chocolatey:

1. Open PowerShell as an administrator.
2. Run the following command:
    ```bash
    Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope Process -Force; [System.Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol = [System.Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol -bor 3072; iex ((New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://community.chocolatey.org/install.ps1'))
    ```
3. Wait for the command to complete.
4. Type choco to make sure Chocolatey is installed:
    ```bash
    PS C:\WINDOWS\system32> choco
    Chocolatey v2.4.1
    Please run 'choco -?' or 'choco <command> -?' for help menu.
    ```
5. Now that you have Chocolatey installed, run the following command to install make:
    ```bash
    PS C:\WINDOWS\system32> choco install make -y
    Chocolatey v2.4.1
    Installing the following packages:
    make
    By installing, you accept licenses for the packages.
    Downloading package from source 'https://community.chocolatey.org/api/v2/'
    Progress: Downloading make 4.4.1... 100%
    
    make v4.4.1 [Approved]
    make package files install completed. Performing other installation steps.
     ShimGen has successfully created a shim for make.exe
     The install of make was successful.
      Deployed to 'C:\ProgramData\chocolatey\lib\make'
    
    Chocolatey installed 1/1 packages.
     See the log for details (C:\ProgramData\chocolatey\logs\chocolatey.log).
