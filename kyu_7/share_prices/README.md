# Share price

You spent all your saved money to buy some shares.

You bought it for `invested`, and want to know how much it's worth,
but all the info you can quickly get are just the change the shares
price made in percentages.

## Your task

Write the function `sharePrice()` that calculates, and returns the
current price of your share, given the following two arguments:
<!-- markdownlint-disable MD013 -->
*   `invested` (number), the amount of money you initially invested in the given share
*   `changes` (array of numbers), contains your shares daily movement percentages
<!-- markdownlint-enable MD013 -->
The returned number, should be in string format, and it's precision
should be fixed at 2 decimal numbers.
<!-- markdownlint-enable MD013 -->
Have fun!

> Hint: Try to write the function in a functional manner!
