# Factorial

In mathematics, the factorial of a non-negative integer `n`,
denoted by `n!`, is the product of all positive integers less
than or equal to `n`. For example: `5! = 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 120`.
By convention the value of `0!` is `1`.

Write a function to calculate factorial for a given input. If input
is below `0` or above `12` throw an exception of type ValueError (Python).
