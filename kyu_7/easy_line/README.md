# Easy Line

In the drawing below we have a part of the Pascal's triangle, lines
are numbered from zero (top).

We want to calculate the sum of the squares of the binomial coefficients
on a given line with a function called easyline (or easyLine or easy-line).

Can you write a program which calculate `easyline(n)` where n is
the line number?

The function will take `n (with: n>= 0)` as parameter and will return
the sum of the squares of the binomial coefficients on line `n`.

## Examples

```text
easyline(0) => 1
easyline(1) => 2
easyline(4) => 70
easyline(50) => 100891344545564193334812497256
```

## Note

In Javascript, Coffeescript, Typescript, C++, PHP, C, R, Nim, Fortran
to get around the fact that we have no big integers the function
easyLine(n) will in fact return `round(log(easyline(n)))` and not
the `easyline(n)` of the other languages.

```text
easyLine(0) => 0
easyLine(1) => 1
easyLine(4) => 70
easyLine(50) => 100891344545564193334812497256
```
