# Password validator

## Description

Your job is to create a simple password validation function,
as seen on many websites.

The rules for a valid password are as follows:

*   There needs to be at least 1 uppercase letter.
*   There needs to be at least 1 lowercase letter.
*   There needs to be at least 1 number.
*   The password needs to be at least 8 characters long.

You are permitted to use any methods to validate the password.

### Examples:

> password("Abcd1234"); ===> true
>
> password("Abcd123"); ===> false
>
> password("abcd1234"); ===> false
>
> password("AbcdefGhijKlmnopQRsTuvwxyZ1234567890"); ===> true
>
> password("ABCD1234"); ===> false
>
> password("Ab1!@#$%^&*()-_+={}[]|\:;?/>.<,"); ===> true;
>
> password("!@#$%^&*()-_+={}[]|\:;?/>.<,"); ===> false;

### Extra info:

*   You will only be passed strings.
*   The string can contain any standard keyboard character.
*   Accepted strings can be any length, as long as they are 8 characters or more.
