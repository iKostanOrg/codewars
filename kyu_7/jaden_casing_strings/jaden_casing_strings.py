    Convert strings to how they would
    be written by Jaden Smith. The strings
    are actual quotes from Jaden Smith,
    but they are not capitalized in the
    same way he originally typed them.

    Example:

            Not Jaden-Cased:
                    "How can mirrors be real if
                    our eyes aren't real"

            Jaden-Cased:
                    "How Can Mirrors Be Real If
                    Our Eyes Aren't Real"
