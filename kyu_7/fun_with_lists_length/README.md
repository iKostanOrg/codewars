# Fun with lists: length

Implement the method length, which accepts a linked list
(head), and returns the length of the list.

For example: Given the list: `1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4`, length should
return 4.

The linked list is defined as follows:

```bash
class Node:
    def __init__(self, data, next=None): 
        self.data = data
        self.next = next
```

**Note:** the list may be null and can hold any type of value.
