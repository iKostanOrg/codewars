## Sum of powers of 2

### Description

Given a number n, you should find a set of numbers for which the sum equals n. This set must consist exclusively of values that are a power of 2 (eg: 2^0 => 1, 2^1 => 2, 2^2 => 4, ...).

The function powers takes a single parameter, the number n, and should return an array of unique numbers.

### Criteria

The function will always receive a valid input: any positive integer between 1 and the max integer value for your language (eg: for JavaScript this would be 9007199254740991 otherwise known as Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER).

The function should return an array of numbers that are a **power of 2** 

> (2^x = y).

Each member of the returned array should be **unique** (eg: the valid answer for powers(2) is 

> `[2]`, not `[1, 1]`)

Members should be sorted in **ascending order** (small -> large). (eg: the valid answer for powers(6) is 

> `[2, 4]`, not `[4, 2]`)
