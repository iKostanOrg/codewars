# Make Class

I don't like writing classes like this:

```python
class Animal:
    def __init__(self, name, species, age, health, weight, color):
        self.name = name
        self.species = species
        self.age = age
        self.health = health
        self.weight = weight
        self.color = color
```    
 
Give me the power to create a similar class like this:

```python
Animal = make_class("name", "species", "age", "health", "weight", "color")
```
