# You're a square

## A square of squares

You like building blocks. You especially like building blocks
that are squares. And what you even like more, is to arrange
them into a square of square building blocks!

However, sometimes, you can't arrange them into a square. Instead,
you end up with an ordinary rectangle! Those blasted things! If you
just had a way to know, whether you're currently working in vainâ€¦ Wait!
That's it! You just have to check if your number of building blocks
is a perfect square.

## Task

Given an integral number, determine if it's a square number:
<!-- markdownlint-disable MD013 -->
> In mathematics, a square number or perfect square is an integer that is the square of an integer; in other words, it is the product of some integer with itself.
<!-- markdownlint-enable MD013 -->
The tests will always use some integral number, so don't worry about
that in dynamic typed languages.

### Examples

```bash
isSquare(-1) returns  false
isSquare(0) returns   true
isSquare(3) returns   false
isSquare(4) returns   true
isSquare(25) returns  true  
isSquare(26) returns  false
```
