    """
    You need to write a function, that returns the
    first non-repeated character in the given string.

    For example for string "test" function should return 'e'.
    For string "teeter" function should return 'r'.

    If a string contains all unique characters, then return
    just the first character of the string.
    Example: for input "trend" function should return 't'

    You can assume, that the input string has always
    non-zero length.
