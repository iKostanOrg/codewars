 # Isograms

An `isogram` is a word that has no repeating letters, consecutive
or non-consecutive. Implement a function that determines whether
a string that contains only letters is an `isogram`. Assume the empty
string is an `isogram`. Ignore letter case.

```text
is_isogram("Dermatoglyphics" ) == true
is_isogram("aba" ) == false
is_isogram("moOse" ) == false # -- ignore letter case
```
