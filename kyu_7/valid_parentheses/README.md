# Valid Parentheses

Write a function that takes a string of parentheses, and determines
if the order of the parentheses is valid. The function should return
true if the string is valid, and false if it's invalid.

Examples:
```bash
"()"              =>  true
")(()))"          =>  false
"("               =>  false
"(())((()())())"  =>  true
```

Constraints

```bash 0 <= length of input <= 100```

- All inputs will be strings, consisting only of characters ( and ).
- Empty strings are considered balanced (and therefore valid), and will be tested.
- For languages with mutable strings, the inputs should not be mutated.

*Tip:* If you are trying to figure out why a string of parentheses is invalid,
paste the parentheses into the code editor, and let the code highlighting show you!
