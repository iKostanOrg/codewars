# Beginner Series #3 Sum of Numbers

Given two integers **a** and **b**, which can be positive or negative,
find the sum of all the numbers between including them too and return it.
If the two numbers are equal return **a** or **b**.

**Note:** a and b are not ordered!

## Examples

```bash
get_sum(1, 0) == 1   // 1 + 0 = 1
get_sum(1, 2) == 3   // 1 + 2 = 3
get_sum(0, 1) == 1   // 0 + 1 = 1
get_sum(1, 1) == 1   // 1 Since both are same
get_sum(-1, 0) == -1 // -1 + 0 = -1
get_sum(-1, 2) == 2  // -1 + 0 + 1 + 2 = 2
```
