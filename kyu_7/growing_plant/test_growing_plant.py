        Testing growing_plant function

        Task

        Each day a plant is growing by upSpeed meters.
        Each night that plant's height decreases by downSpeed
        meters due to the lack of sun heat. Initially, plant
        is 0 meters tall. We plant the seed at the beginning
        of a day. We want to know when the height of the plant
        will reach a certain level.

        Example

        For upSpeed = 100, downSpeed = 10 and desiredHeight = 910,
        the output should be 10.

        For upSpeed = 10, downSpeed = 9 and desiredHeight = 4,
        the output should be 1. Because the plant reach to the desired
        height at day 1(10 meters).

        Input/Output

        [input] integer upSpeed
        A positive integer representing the daily growth.
        Constraints: 5 ≤ upSpeed ≤ 100.

        [input] integer downSpeed
        A positive integer representing the nightly decline.
        Constraints: 2 ≤ downSpeed < upSpeed.

        [input] integer desiredHeight
        A positive integer representing the threshold.
        Constraints: 4 ≤ desiredHeight ≤ 1000.

        [output] an integer

        The number of days that it will take for the plant to
        reach/pass desiredHeight (including the last day in the
        total count).
